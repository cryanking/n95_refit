	abstract = {The prevalence of interval censored data is increasing in medical studies due to the growing use of biomarkers to define a disease progression endpoint. Interval censoring results from periodic monitoring of the progression status. For example, disease progression is established in the interval between the clinic visit where progression is recorded and the prior clinic visit where there was no evidence of disease progression. A methodology is proposed for estimation and inference on the regression coefficients in the Cox proportional hazards model with interval censored data. The methodology is based on estimating equations and uses an inverse probability weight to select event time pairs where the ordering is unambiguous. Simulations are performed to examine the finite sample properties of the estimate and a colon cancer data set is used to demonstrate its performance relative to the conventional partial likelihood estimate that ignores the interval censoring.},

	abstract = {The proportional hazards model ({PH}) is currently the most popular regression model for analyzing time-to-event data. Despite its popularity, the analysis of interval-censored data under the {PH} model can be challenging using many available techniques. This paper presents a new method for analyzing interval-censored data under the {PH} model. The proposed approach uses a monotone spline representation to approximate the unknown nondecreasing cumulative baseline hazard function. Formulating the {PH} model in this fashion results in a finite number of parameters to estimate while maintaining substantial modeling flexibility. A novel expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm is developed for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The derivation of the {EM} algorithm relies on a two-stage data augmentation involving latent Poisson random variables. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, robust to initialization, enjoys quick convergence, and provides closed-form variance estimates. The performance of the proposed regression methodology is evaluated through a simulation study, and is further illustrated using data from a large population-based randomized trial designed and sponsored by the United States National Cancer Institute.},

	abstract = {We consider the Cox model with piecewise constant baseline hazard to deal with a mixed case of left-censored, interval-censored and right-censored data. Estimation is carried out with the {EM} algorithm by treating the true event times as unobserved variables. This estimation procedure is shown to produce a block diagonal Hessian matrix of the baseline parameters. Taking advantage of this interesting feature of the estimation procedure a L0 penalised likelihood method is implemented in order to automatically determine the number and locations of the cuts of the baseline hazard. The method is directly extended to the inclusion of exact observations and to a cure fraction. Statistical inference of the model parameters is derived from likelihood theory. Through simulation studies, the penalisation technique is shown to provide a good ﬁt of the baseline hazard and precise estimations of the resulting regression parameters. The method is illustrated on a dental dataset where the eﬀect of covariates on the risk of ankylosis for replanted teeth is assessed.},

	abstract = {This book contains the lecture notes for a {DMV} course presented by the authors at Gunzburg, Germany, in September, 1990. In the course we sketched the theory of information bounds for non parametric and semiparametric models, and developed the theory of non parametric maximum likelihood estimation in several particular inverse problems: interval censoring and deconvolution models. Part I, based on Jon Wellner's lectures, gives a brief sketch of information lower bound theory: Hajek's convolution theorem and extensions, useful minimax bounds for parametric problems due to Ibragimov and Has'minskii, and a recent result characterizing differentiable functionals due to van der Vaart (1991). The differentiability theorem is illustrated with the examples of interval censoring and deconvolution (which are pursued from the estimation perspective in part {II}). The differentiability theorem gives a way of clearly distinguishing situations in which 1 2 the parameter of interest can be estimated at rate n / and situations in which this is not the case. However it says nothing about which rates to expect when the functional is not differentiable. Even the casual reader will notice that several models are introduced, but not pursued in any detail; many problems remain. Part {II}, based on Piet Groeneboom's lectures, focuses on non parametric maximum likelihood estimates ({NPMLE}'s) for certain inverse problems. The first chapter deals with the interval censoring problem.},

	abstract = {Parametric models for interval censored data can now easily be fitted with minimal programming in certain standard statistical software packages. Regression equations can be introduced, both for the location and for the dispersion parameters. Finite mixture models can also be fitted, with a point mass on right (or left) censored observations, to allow for individuals who cannot have the event (or already have it). This mixing probability can also be allowed to follow a regression equation. Here, models based on nine different distributions are compared for three examples of heavily censored data as well as a set of simulated data. We find that, for parametric models, interval censoring can often be ignored and that the density, at centres of intervals, can be used instead in the likelihood function, although the approximation is not always reliable. In the context of heavily interval censored data, the conclusions from parametric models are remarkably robust with changing distributional assumptions and generally more informative than the corresponding non-parametric models.},
